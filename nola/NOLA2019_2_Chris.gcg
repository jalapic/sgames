#note went short when should have played long DIGLOT ... still don't have terrific intuition about when to go long vs short.

#note Q prefers playing under keeping GAN with AEON or EOAN for 6 fewer.  Probably less dangerous and a better leave.

>James_Curley: AEINOOU 1M NOO +18 239
#note got freaked out by my own opening and wanted to block it. Actually sims well, but 1N OU is better.

#note was hoping for a floating R.  Given he seems to be playing short, wanted to restrict the board while scoring.

#note was happy to see this that I didn't look for NICOISE in the same spot for two more.

>James_Curley: EIMNRTU O6 MU. +5 375
#note So by now I have him on a really strong rack.  I decided to try and block the O column. I should have done this by playing long. But I didn't want to draw the Q.   Quackle likes just scoring and trying to outrun.
>Chris_Lipe: EHH 11E HEH +38 354
>James_Curley: EILNRST 12B TRES +17 392
#note less than 90 seconds to play and all I could see were huge plays with the Q? or Z? from 12A. I decided to block with TRES and hope not to draw the Q.   There are also things like SQUiZ down from HEH.   Quackle likes C7 (ELF)IN to achieve the same thing whilst keeping a very nice leave.
