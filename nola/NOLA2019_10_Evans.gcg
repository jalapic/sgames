#note Missed the 9.  Didn't even look for it. Sad.
>Austin_Shin: BEN 12F B.NE +21 154
>James_Curley: CEIIPST 4F .EPICTS +30 222
#note Saw the bingo immediately and wrote it down.  Then while I was waiting my turn I started to doubt myself.  Then when it was my turn I decided I needed to keep scoring and play this terrible play. Even 14E I(KON) is much better.   
>Austin_Shin: ?DEGNRU K4 .RUDGENs +86 240
>James_Curley: EIIPUYZ H1 ZIP.Y +63 285
#note Still better than YUP(P)IE despite the leave.
>Austin_Shin: ABH 14A BAH +31 271
>James_Curley: EEIOQRU 2F QU.RE +36 321
#note I considered this, and 6J Q(U)EUE or Q(U)EUER.  I didn't like being too aggressive with the others so went with my play which also blocks the floaters at the top.  The problem is the leave ...

#note lucky fit

>Austin_Shin: GUV M5 GUV +22 321
>James_Curley: EIIOOST N5 ITS +20 370
#note Took for ever on this turn.  I was sure that Austin was setting up a nice hook for a bingo lane and thought I should block.  I saw OTIOSE from N2 but didn't like leaving hooks for DIVE- available.  I guess I just cannot leave EIOO on my rack though.
>Austin_Shin: GHNOT O1 THONG +35 356
>James_Curley: AEIOOOU 1J EUOI +7 377
#note I have terrible natural instincts for when to exchange and when not to.  Also, I completely whiffed on (Z)OOEA here.
>Austin_Shin: ASY 13A AYS +37 393
>James_Curley: AAENOOT J8 ANA +18 395
#note Q's only suggestion is to play 2L NOA(H) and maybe try to go out in one ?  AEOT is more balanced than my leave of EOOT.  I had the same idea, just poorer execution.
>Austin_Shin: DEFO 13L DEFO +25 418
>James_Curley: ELOOT O12 T.LE +15 410
#note No time, but O(R)LE at H7 is nice to block Ausni's highet plays.  I  saw the possibility of A(J)aR so should have zoned in on it.
