#note I should exchange to DIR.  I considered this.  I think I have a fear of getting too far behind too early and am too reluctant to exchange.
>Jason_Ubeika: OPP 7C POP +20 46
>James_Curley: EIOORSU -OOU +0 13
#note Now I exchange and quackle likes 10B EUOI.  Is this to restrict scoring by opponent while keeping a fairly good leave ORS ?
>Jason_Ubeika: LOY 6B LOY +20 66
>James_Curley: DEGIRRS 10G GIRDERS +67 80
#note Did not look hard enough for the overlap three to the left.
>Jason_Ubeika: AAEINRT M6 ANTI.ERA +70 136
>James_Curley: ?EIIQSV 11E QIS +29 109
#note or play 12H QuIVE(R) for 54 and draw level now, keeping IS.  
>Jason_Ubeika: CGILN N2 CLING +31 167
#note made me think he has the other C. for C-LOY ?
>James_Curley: ?EINSTV K5 INViT.ES +90 199
>Jason_Ubeika: ACDEETU A3 EDUCATE +95 262
>James_Curley: AAGIMTU B9 AMAUTI +30 229
#note here or O column?   Note - I didn't know the K back hook to AMAUTI-K.
>Jason_Ubeika: AVW 12H VAW. +14 276
>James_Curley: ABGLNOS A12 GABS +38 267
#note Went greedy for points.  Q likes O6 OBANG for 10 fewer.  Also 13I BO for 19 fewer. That seems too crazy for me.
>Jason_Ubeika: HMO O1 MHO +33 309
>James_Curley: AEEKLNO O5 OAKEN +33 300
#note Also considered L1 KEENO which I like better in retrospect.  Bingo % goes from 7% to 16% with that play.
>Jason_Ubeika: IZ J12 .IZ +35 344
>James_Curley: ELLOOOW J2 WOOL +17 317
#note Not as good as 4A (D)EWOOL which I didn't spot.
>Jason_Ubeika: ER A1 RE....... +36 380
>James_Curley: EEEFLOR H12 .OLE +21 338
#note Everything looks grim. My other considered candidate was 14F FREE(ZE) which sims top. Think I didn't like it because possible huge X plays along L15, but maybe I need to open that for myself.
>Jason_Ubeika: EJT G13 JET +39 419
>James_Curley: DEEFNOR 3E FORED.NE +65 403
#note There are no winning fishes. All are blockable.  Took me a long time to play this bingo as I was looking for possible one tile fishes.  Then when I got round to playing it, I didn't factor in how easy it made scoring with the X.
>Jason_Ubeika: ?EHIRUX 4F HEX +45 464
#note best plays are RH(E)XIs or RH(E)XEs
