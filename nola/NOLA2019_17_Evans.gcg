#note Probably thought for too long about whether to put the S on and get rid of one more consonant, but with blank in hand didn't liek blocking the O column with not too many bingo lines available.

#note he blocked HED(G)EhOG!.   Here I completely missed HO(G)GED. This is far above everything else as it scores 49 points.  My play sims quite far down the list.  I was focused on trying to open another lane for my blank  with a friendly pool.  I think it perhaps isn't that great of an opening though as SHOE- takes D/R/S  hooks - too many for it to stay open for sure.

#note Two points fewer than REGREDE,REGRADE using SHOER but I wasn't 100% sure of the SHOER hook.

#note This took me too long to find.  Fortunately I played quickly during the game to give myself thinking time.  My first plan was to look for ways to fish for bingos. I came up with (AD)O to set up a column A bingo lane. I was also trying to see if I could draw into anything that fit across row 7 with this play, but didn't see it.  After a couple of minutes I went for plan B which was to try and outrun Evans by playing long and then out in one (with a lucky pick from the bag).  When I saw this play I obviously went with it.  According to Champ Player this wins 33% of the time and (AD)O wins 28%.
